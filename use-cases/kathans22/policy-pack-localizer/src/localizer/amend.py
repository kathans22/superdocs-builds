    changed/unchanged split by construction — useful as a check afterward.)

    (generate_change_notice), fill in its one interpretive line with a

    quoted before/after text, and export.

    Cost: one operation for this country — a single-document call, unlike
    a pack's multi-section batch (CLAUDE.md's economics). Unlike
    translate.derive_core, this is NOT cached across countries sharing a
    language: each notice is a distinct per-office document (its header,
    return date, and the model's summary text all belong to that one
    document instance), so IN and KE — both English — each cost their own
    operation, matching CLAUDE.md's worked example (2 en notices = 2 ops,
    not 1). Idempotency is still per (country_code, from_version,
    to_version): rerunning for a country already notified at this version
    pair makes no SuperDocs call and spends no operation.

    The model is asked to do exactly one thing — replace the placeholder
    with a short plain-language explanation, grounded only in the
    'Previously'/'Now' text already in the draft — and never to touch
    anything else. The response is not trusted on its own: after export,
    this function checks the placeholder is gone AND that every quoted
    before/after section body still appears verbatim (normalised), the
    same "verify the artifact, not the promise" discipline packs.py
    applies to an annex batch.

    Bounded retry (_MAX_NOTICE_ATTEMPTS): live testing showed a call can
    come back with a confused non-edit response ("I am not sure how to
    help you...", changes: null) while still being billed — the same class
    of unreliability documented for pack generation in
    evidence/superdocs-batch-limit-report.md, here on a single-section
    document instead of a batch. Each attempt is its own ledger line, so a
    notice that needed a retry honestly costs 2 operations, not the
    idealised 1 — the ledger reports what actually happened, never an
    assumed constant.
